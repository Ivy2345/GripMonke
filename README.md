Mod for Gorilla Tag that disables slipping on slippery walls

You are currently on the **next** branch. This branch contains potentially unstable or incomplete patches, and may not work as intended, please switch to the **release** branch if you'd like to compile a release version.

**REQUIRES COMPUTER INTERFACE AND UTILLA**

| Version | Supported          | Requirements               |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Utilla, Computer Interface |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                | Computer Interface         |

## Quick note:
I'm expecting some more cracks of this mod because of the release of the very, very slippery **Mountains** map! Please DM me about that if you see it (libregoat#8102).

Usage: Simply install the mod, Computer Interface, and Utilla then go into a modded lobby. The mod will not work if you aren't in a modded lobby first. Enable and disable the mod from the Mod Status menu.
